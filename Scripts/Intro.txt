Based on Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, I developed a solution in C# using .NET Core and Entity Framework Core 
to optimize database access and management. I implemented the generic repository pattern to encapsulate CRUD operations, 
ensuring a clear separation between the domain and persistence layers. Business logic was centralized into domain services,
 managed through dependency injection via the .NET Core service container. Additionally, I used GitHub Copilot to streamline 
 development, benefiting from its ability to point out smart code snippets, reduce common errors, and facilitate the 
 implementation of complex features, enabling faster and more efficient development.
